                <img src="images/2.png" alt="">
                <p>I have worked as a delivery messenger for several years and know the city quite well. I like to watch movies and series when I have time. I enjoy reading current articles on topics such as art, philosophy, science, technology, astronautics, military context, creative design, economics, automotive, and many other things.</p>

                <img src="images/sena-logo.png" alt="">
                <p>I am currently an apprentice in software development technology at SENA. I have practiced with technologies dedicated to web development such as HTML and CSS, and desktop application development with Java. I have also learned object-oriented programming (OOP) techniques and the MVC model for data organization. Additionally, I use SQL for data management. Programming logic is fundamental in my learning process, and most of this information is available in English, which helps to stay updated in various areas of knowledge.</p>

                <h1>What Do I Do on the Internet?</h1>
                <p>When I browse the internet, I watch videos and read articles to stay informed about what is happening in our context. Many people, like me, use this tool for education and entertainment. We use browsing to learn from courses but also for work. Many of the people I ask what they do on the internet respond that they seek to get informed, know, and learn. </p>

                <p><strong>My Day:</strong> I wake up early to go to work as a messenger. After work, I browse the internet to take courses, watch entertainment, and then go to my classes at SENA. I return home very late at night, do several tasks, and go to sleep..</p>

                <p><strong>My Mother's Day:</strong> My mother wakes up before me, helps me wake up to go to work, prepares my breakfast, and reminds me of the work start time. During the day, she tidies up the house, prepares lunch, takes online courses on various topics, rests, and works on artistic projects. She takes care of our pet, a parrot named Pollo, and in the afternoon, she prepares meals and waits for my return from work to then get everything ready for me to go to study.</p>

                <p>Learning English is vital because the best information is in this language. It makes it easier to stay updated in almost all areas of knowledge.</p>
